# BellyButtonDashboard
## Purpose:
    For the most part, the microbes in your navel are harmless. In fact, recent studies suggest that bacteria on your body may strengthen your skin's defense system, but if you never clean your belly button, they'll grow unencumbered, and that can be a problem. Therefore, this project has been analyzied so that volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons, from the data provided to us.
    Below is how the dashboard looks like.

   - Lastly, we created a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.
